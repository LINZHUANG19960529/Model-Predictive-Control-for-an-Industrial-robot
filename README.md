Implementation of nonlinear model predictive control for an industrial robot


Many robotic industrial applications, such as milling, drilling, gluing, laser-cutting or such high precision measurements, do
require the precise following of a predened geometric(reference) path. So, the idea is to design an appropriate controller which achieves the desired goal and the type
of controller plays an important role in this applications. Of all control strategies, model predictive controller helps achieve the trajectory following in the optimal way,
by predicting the output states of the system,and using this inherent characteristics, implementation of model predictive path-following control for an industrial robot is
done. For this purpose, consider constrained output path following with and without reference speed assignment.Also, during the design stages, stability is included as the
important consideration and with the knowledge of optimal control and sequential quadratic programming being applied to the non-linear model predictive controller, and hence defining appropriate controller law, one can address the path-following
problem for any system.
